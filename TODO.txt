strict mode:

If all numbers are treated the same, what happens with % and << >>?
	There are no built-in math functions or operators, but what if
	the user defines one?

Is joinVars even necessary? How can you get different types in different cflow
paths if you can't assign a different type?
Related: in setVar check for assignability, not equality.

relaxed equality rules: see doc
	One may not compare an int and a float

TODO: template and define
	All template calls must pass the identical type.
